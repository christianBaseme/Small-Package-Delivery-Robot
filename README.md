# Small-Package-Delivery-Robot
The goal for this was to create a robot that can function with little help from the human being as much as possible. The idea is given how prone human beings are to destruction it will be great to create tools that can function independently. And for this project using the ultrasonic sensor seemed a great idea to achieve the goal. For future I was intending to also add cameras, possibly replace the bluetooth functionality with wifi, IR (Infrared) sensor for motion detection. Am using “was” instead of “am” because these goals were set at the beginning of the project, and as I gain more knowledge on hardware and embedded systems my goals have been shifting.
